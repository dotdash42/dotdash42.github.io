# Insects

The scientific name for what most of us consider bugs is arthropods. Arthropods include insects, spiders (called Arachnids), and crustaceans. Crustaceans don't usually count as "bugs". These include crabs, lobster, and shrimp. An arthropod is defined as an animal having a hard exoskeleton with joints and paired jointed legs.

## About Insects

There are more types of insects than any other type of animal on the planet. The main categories of insects are butterflies, moths, beetles, centipedes, flies, grasshoppers, and social insects. Insects tend to be small, but can vary in size from nearly invisible to over 7 inches long.

## What makes an insect an insect?

    1. Insects all have a hard external covering made of something called chitin.
    2. Their bodies are made up of three sections called the head, the thorax, and abdomen.
    3. All insects will have a pair of antennae on their head.
    4. They all have six legs connected to the thorax (arachnids will have eight legs).
    5. Some insects have wings connected to the thorax and can fly.




Insects are born from eggs. Young insects are called nymphs. As insects grow, they get a new hard outer covering by getting rid of the old covering and growing a new one. This process is called molting.

Social insects live in large groups and work together to survive and build their homes. Some examples are bees, ants, wasps, and termites.

The study of insects is called entomology.

## About Arachnids

There are over 100,000 species of arachnids. The word arachnid comes from a Greek word meaning spider. As a result, arachnids are commonly called spiders. However, there are some non-spider like bugs such as scorpions and ticks that are included in arachnids.

## What makes an arachnid?

    They have two main body sections called the cephalothorax and the abdomen.
    They have eight legs.
    They have simple eyes versus the insect's compound eyes.
    Unlike insects they do not have antenna or wings.
    They have an exoskeleton and lay eggs.

## Body sections of an arachnid or spider
1. 4 pairs of legs
2. cephalothorax
3. abdomen


## Fun Facts About Insects
